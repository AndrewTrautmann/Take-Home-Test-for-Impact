The files that is required for the test, can be found within the repository.

I wrote the answer for the questions in java using the Netbeans IDE.

You can pull the repository by using either a tool (Github Desktop, etc.) or you can download the zip file and extract it on your personal device. 

To run the project, go to Netbeans->File->Open Project

The implementation of my code is done in the "Summarizer.java" class, and my unit testing is done within the "SummarizerTest.java" class. 

You are able to run and see the unit testing result by right clicking on the project and click on "Test(alt + F6)".
